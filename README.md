# q4ghostpost
This assessment was completed during the 4th quarter of the year that I studied at Kenzie


This assessment has a React front-end and a Django back-end.

You will need two terminals open to run this program after you clone this repo down onto your machine. 

You will also need to have Poetry installed on your machine. 

In terminal 1:
Run npm i to install dependencies.
Then npm start to spin up the front end server on localhost:3000

In terminal 2:
Run poetry install to install dependencies.
Run poetry shell to activate the virtual environment
Then python manage.py runserver to spin up the back end server

After that, you can post "ghostposts", view different pages to see them filtered accordingly, and up vote or down vote them
